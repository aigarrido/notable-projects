# E-waste and circular economy infographic

This project is an infographic is about e-waste and circular economy. 


It explains that e-waste is generated by electronic devices and their use or manufacture, and includes phones, computers, screens, printers and more. It also explains that the lack of responsible e-waste management policies has led to many of these wastes being sent to low-income countries, where bad practices occur, including incomplete recycling, dumping in landfills, illegal burning, black markets, labor and child exploitation, and generating numerous health, social, and ecological problems. 

Finally, the infographic also mentions various emerging technologies that promise to reduce costs and favor local material recovery.
