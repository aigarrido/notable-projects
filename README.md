# Notable Projects

### by Andr√©s Garrido Nervi

The purpose of this repository is to collect and recover some of the projects I've worked on during my time at the university and beyond.

This collection serves as a showcase of the academic and personal projects I've been involved in. Beyond showcasing my work, I've also included documentation, code samples, and explanations to provide insights into my journey.

It's worth mentioning that certain projects may be partially or entirely presented in Spanish, either due to assignment requirements or language barriers with the team. Over time, I'll be translating the work when possible.

My career degree has led me to work on a variety of projects, some with a focus on design and others centered around computer engineering and programming. This diversity stems from the multifaceted nature of my education and will show very distinct types of work. 

Lastly, I'll be translating and showcasing some of my proudest work below.
